// `:revdate:` is specified from the CLI with the data coming from attributes/revdate.txt.
// For PowerShell, see `generate-pdf.ps1`. We organized things this way so that we can specify the correct
// publish dates of the document in the Releases page in our GitHub repository in a simple manner. Note that
// we have created a GitHub Action that will automatically generate a release when there is a new commit in
// the master branch.
